- [Aurora/Sunspot](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/support-center/aurora-sunspot): Information on getting your code ready for our upcoming exacale supercomputer.
- [Polaris](polaris/getting-started.md): Information on how to get started our newest supercomputer.
- [AI Testbed](ai-testbed/getting-started.md): Information on how to use our AI Accelerators.
- [Services](services/getting-started.md): Information on how to use various services provided across clusters.
- [Facility Policies](policies/facility-policies.md): Information on our policies and procedures.

## How to Get Access
Researchers interested in using the ALCF systems (including Polaris and the AI Testbed’s Cerebras CS-2 and SambaNova DataScale platforms) can now submit project proposals via the [ALCF’s Director’s Discretionary program](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/directors-discretionary-allocation-program). Calls for porposals for additional allocation programs will be open at a later date.

Submit your proposal requests at: [Allocation Request Page](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/science/directors-discretionary-allocation-program)
